## Usage

> BASIC RULES
> To start the game, each player is dealt 10 cards and the motherfxckin' judge is randomly selected. The black card
> of doom is displayed on the gameboard and everyone except the motherfxckin' judge plays the 'appropriate' white card.
> For full effect, the motherfxckin' judge should read the white cards aloud, dramatically. Then she/he may choose
> the winner, who gets a point. Then start a new round, and the judge will rotate. Play until you are drunk or out of alcohol.
> Why's the rum gone?
